Today I got to see how some shaders worked and what it is like to implement them. During class, I was able to implement the regular one (which was just applying a texture and a color), the Rim lighting one, and the reflection one. I then copy and pasted Alvaro's code for the world position one to see what it look like but I did not type that one myself. 

I still feel I lack understanding in the making of shaders and I am quite lost in this class. I feel as if I am simply copying down text but I do not understand what exactly the code does and why I am writing it. I do not know what a lot of these terms mean and I have nothing to relate it in my head if that makes sense. Like I am told to manipulate the vertex and fragment but I'm not sure what that actually means. The syntax is also new to me as well.

Good news is I am starting to pick up small patterns here and there. Every shader needs a vertex and a shader I think, or else it gets errors. At the top of the shader that I write are the properties and those will the variables available to me in the inspector. That's all though... Not exactly sure why floats have float1, 2, 3, 4. Not sure what TEXCOORD1, 2, 3, 4 is refering to. There is a lot left for me to process but I am working on it.

From the shaders I looked at today, the rim lighting seems to be the one I would be most likely to use most often. I like the glow effect it gives the objects in my scene. Hearing Alvaro talk about the reflection shader is also intriguing because I would like to include water in my GDW game and the reflections would add a lot of juice.

Outside of shaders, I am getting better at using github too!
