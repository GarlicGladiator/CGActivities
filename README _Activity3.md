I learned a lot today. I was able to experiment with tiling textures. I simply applied my 2D character from last year onto the monkey model. That one is pretty simple to understand. The next shader that I implemented were the two shadow ones. I noticed that only the object has a shadow but it does not cast a shadow. The second one does cast a shadow but it had an issue when I first tested it. The side of the object that was in light had the shadow, which doesnt make sense. The tinting did not work very well either, or at least I did not like the effect. I swapped the shadowAmmount and shadowTint parameters and it flipped it for me. The colors were then inverted so I had to use 1 minus to fix that and it makes the shadow tint look pretty cool. The glass shader did not work when I tested it. But I added a line to blend things and it is now transparent. The bump offset was very cool looking. The two water shaders were very similar to something I made for the project progression. I have the same wave effect using sine waves on the vertex shader. I also had the scrolling voronoi for my own water shader. In my personal shader I added a foam effect on intersections as well but that was very complicated. For this activity, I just used my normal map as a water texture. For the foam I just put the trees png I had just to test to see if it worked. Very cool shaders and the ones today are very versatile and can be used for almost any game. Every game has shadows. A lot of games have glass and water as well.
